       <p>""Kerbal Space Program is more than a game, it's a sandbox which has catalyzed players to learn physics, understand engineering, set themselves challenges and perhaps build the occasional monstrosity which pushes the limits of the physics engine. However in this age of digital downloads the game has never had a physical printed manual, and this book sets out to remedy this shortcoming. Guiding the reader through the basic building, flying and astronavigation skills needed to go anywhere in the Kerbol system.  It even taught me a few things about modding and electronics. Fly Safe!" - Scott Manley, YouTuber" <em>â€” <a href="https://twitter.com/DJSnM">Scott Manley</a>, YouTuber</em></p>
